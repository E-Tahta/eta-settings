If you are interested in taking over maintenance of this addon, you are welcome to fork it under the GPL/MPL license. All code is available within the addon itself.\n\nPlease do not contact me with requests to update Grab and Drag for compatibility with any new releases of Firefox. I no longer have the time to do so. Thank you.\n\nNote: This add-on was originally developed in 2005, for pen-based devices. It provided iPhone-style scrolling in Firefox several years before the iPhone was even released. Most of the important features of this addon are now native to Firefox on modern tablet devices. If you're running one of these (e.g. Windows 8 touch-based device), this add-on is not useful for you.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":"The following license applies to all code files:\n\n* Version: MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1\n*\n* The contents of this archive are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version\n* 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with\n* the License.
