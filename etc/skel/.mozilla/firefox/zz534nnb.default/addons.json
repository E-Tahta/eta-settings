Useful for (older) pen or touchscreen-based devices for which these gestures are not natively supported. Not useful on Windows 8 touch devices.","fullDescription":"Grab and Drag is no longer under active maintenance. If you are interested in taking over maintenance of this addon, you are welcome to fork it under the GPL/MPL license. All code is available within the addon itself.\n\nPlease do not contact me with requests to update Grab and Drag. I no longer have the time to do so. Thank you.\n\nNote: This add-on was originally developed in 2005, for pen-based devices. It provided iPhone-style scrolling in Firefox several years before the iPhone was even released. Most of the important features of this addon are now native to Firefox on modern tablet devices. If you're running one of these (e.g. Windows 8 touch-based device), this add-on is not useful for you.","weeklyDownloads":826,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Ian","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/tr/firefox/user/ian-weiner/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/12/12854.png?modified=1530207879","width":58,"height":30,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/12/12854.png?modified=1530207879","thumbnailWidth":58,"thumbnailHeight":30,"caption":"Grabbing hand mouse cursors"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/12/12855.png?modified=1530207880","width":198,"height":88,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/12/12855.png?modified=1530207880","thumbnailWidth":198,"thumbnailHeight":88,"caption":"Toolbar toggle icon"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/12/12856.png?modified=1530207882","width":529,"height":399,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/12/12856.png?modified=1530207882","thumbnailWidth":265,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Grab and Drag 2.0 Wizard"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/12/12857.png?modified=1530207883","width":468,"height":416,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/12/12857.png?modified=1530207883","thumbnailWidth":225,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Grab and Drag 2.0 Preferences"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.4306,"reviewCount":280,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/tr/firefox/addon/grab-and-drag/reviews/","updateDate":1481787360000},{"id":"juraj.masiar@gmail.com_ScrollAnywhere","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/745/745973-32.png?modified=1530627624","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/745/745973-64.png?modified=1530627624"},"name":"ScrollAnywhere","version":"6.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1004707/scrollanywhere-6.0-an+fx.xpi?src=","size":48488,"homepageURL":"https://fastaddons.com/","supportURL":"https://fastaddons.com/","description":"Grab and drag your scrollbar with your middle mouse button anywhere on the page.\n\nFeatures also:\n- \"grab and drag\" - phone like scroll style\n- The Momentum - including infinite scroll\n\nWarning: very addictive! :)\n\nwww.FastAddons.com","fullDescription":"Scroll Anywhere enables you to drag scrollbar with your middle (or right / left) mouse button without actually touching a scrollbar.
